Particle Clouds

Take a look at Nature of Code Chapter 4: Particle Systems. Read sections 4.1 through 4.5. Create a particle cloud system in p5.js. Review the examples from Nature of Code in Processing, the p5.js code we created in class this past week and vectors (Chapter 1 in Nature of Code).

This example must be created in p5.js. Utilize an array, vectors and have a lifespan. This is due before class on Thursday November 19th via your GitHub account.
